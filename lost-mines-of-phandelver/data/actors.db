are the largest of the wild dog species roaming the plains and forests of our wonderful world.  Anywhere from light brown to a midnight black in coloration, wolves stand as the common ancestor to all natural dog species currently inhabiting the planet.  Wolves have a long, broad muzzle filled with sharp teeth, a thick coat to insulate them from difficult winters, and keen eyes and ears with which they may track a target.  The most amazing aspect of the wolf is its incredible nose which can smell prey from up to one and a half miles away.  This amazing nose (packed with hundreds of millions of scent receptors) can also determine the mood of other wolves, what they've eaten, and even where they've been..</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolves Among Us.</strong> As is common with many other dog species, wolves live in communities called packs.  WIthin the pack, wolves hunt together, raise their young together, and provide group protection.  When encountering wolves, be wary should you only spy a single animal prowling the area.  It's quite likely where there is a straggler wolf, the rest of the pack lurks nearby ready to defend their family from attack.  Wolves, which unable to speak, are able to “communicate” via barks and growls as well as follow simplistic tactics such as flanking maneuvers or surprise attacks.  The strength of the pack allows for the wolves to combine their intelligence and form a deadly fighting force of gnashing teeth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have advantage on Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Survival}) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Explorer</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the ranger spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Stealth}) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Blinded]{blinded} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Deafened]{deafened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89","identifier":"ranger","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"ewpjd4ok2lo8aovh","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":["ani","inv","ste"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FXRQBhDqRK3rODE5":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":110850284,"definitionId":5,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"xpt81zx5z47797rr"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Ranger"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"f55d5d6b04afda371e6a704ffb083282e602fbce"}}},{"_id":"oE9uTFi8mTCljc6P","name":"High Elf","type":"feat","img":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9/366/636327456833931461.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it.</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed\"><strong>Racial Traits</strong><br />+2 Dexterity, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Darkvision]{Darkvision}, Keen Senses, Fey Ancestry, Trance</p><p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.</p>\n<p>The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>\n\n<p><b>@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Darkvision]{Darkvision}</b></p>\n<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Increase</b></p>\n<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>\n\n<p><b>Languages</b></p>\n<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\n\n<p><b>Age</b></p>\n<p>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\n\n<p><b>Size</b></p>\n<p>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.

threat.  Hailing from a group of creatures called goblinoids (which includes bugbears and hobgoblins), the goblin is a foul humanoid measuring no larger than the average halfling.  Goblins have skin tones varying from light clay to deep chestnut brown to a sickly, acidic green, their hair is thin and greasy, and within their jaws rest cracked and sharpened teeth.  Together with their foaming fellows, goblins form loose collectives or tribes so their power can stand pronounced in numbers.  The tribal life also allows for a crude caste system to erupt from the goblin's chaotic politics.  All goblins have something to offer to the tribe, be they foragers, slavers, or warriors.  If they cannot contribute, they die.</p>\n<p><strong>We Live in a Society. </strong> Capricious to the last, goblins crave nothing more than power and domination of all others around them by any means (including those methods dangerous to the goblin).  Those goblins who possess enough might or cleverness may ascend to the rank of Goblin Boss and command a lair consisting of several dozens goblinoid fellows.  Should ambition prove overwhelming, the boss in rare cases may subjugate nearby lairs of rival goblinoids and crown themselves a Goblin Queen/King.  It has been documented that in one particular case, Queen Greld the Gutripper was able to enslave a camp containing hundreds of orcs, then laid siege to the city of Westerholt close by and sacked the entire city.</p>\n<p><strong>Gnash and Bite, Trick and Trap.</strong> Goblins maintain some of the most chaotic lairs within the known world, and to accomplish this the goblins require a plethora of slaves.  Not always willing to murder those they plunder, goblins and their kin are known slavers, spiriting away captured humans from merchant wagons to contruct their insidious dungeons.  WIthin a goblin lair is all manner of trap: tunnels leading nowhere, narrow passages no human could pass through, arrow slits, pits lined with spikes, and of course a multitude of alarms to warn the tribe of any impending danger.  Goblins utilize chaotic placement within their lairs to throw off intruders from their hard earned loot which is kept safe within the lair's heart.</p>\n<p><strong>And They Dance About the Flames.</strong> Goblins, though commonly thought of as greedy and stupid, leave their chaotic tendancies behind when it comes to the structure of religious worship.  They are beholden in particular to The God of the Goblins, also called They Who Lurk Beneath, who acts as chief of all other gods to the goblinoids.  This god encourages acts of violence, blind cruelty, enslaving others, as well as war amongst the enemies of the goblins.  Goblin tribes will join together in times of worship to dance, perform rituals with blood and bone, build massive bonfires, and sew chaos throughout the lair all in devotion to their evil benefactor.  Goblins, fueled by the spirit of the revelry, will then be exceedingly aggressive and volatile for the days after, raging through the surrounding area to sate the thirst of their cruel god.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry

Ability]{Survival}</p>\n\n<p><b>Rage</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious} or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Blinded]{blinded}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Deafened]{deafened}, or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} of your rage. The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Persistent Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious} or if you choose to end it.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Indomitable Might</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Champion</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</span></p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a greataxe or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any martial melee weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two handaxes or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) any simple weapon</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">An explorer’s pack and four javelins</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 46","identifier":"barbarian","levels":1,"hitDice":"d12","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"7pmeagstn5j90rb0","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"93ej7u8sa9tl57x1","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"rage","type":"numeric","scale":{"1":{"value":2},"9":{"value":3},"16":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Rage","icon":""}],"saves":["str","con"],"skills":{"number":0,"choices":[],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FXRQBhDqRK3rODE5":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":107420150,"definitionId":9,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"importId":"q1i3epfggta8xm5s"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Barbarian"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"54ea373bd978ad74032e9287ad5bafa9316a98fb"}}},{"_id":"QeSMJ9mUOBi5N2hp","name":"Half-Orc","type":"feat","img":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9/385/636327460616726799.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Some half-orcs rise to become proud leaders of orc communities.

spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"wizard","levels":1,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"]},"value":{"added":{"7n8vv8wqrmba1to5":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","w3f67pk63uafk6ys":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"]},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max"},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"FXRQBhDqRK3rODE5":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}}},{"_id":"7n8vv8wqrmba1to5","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","type":"feat","img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.
